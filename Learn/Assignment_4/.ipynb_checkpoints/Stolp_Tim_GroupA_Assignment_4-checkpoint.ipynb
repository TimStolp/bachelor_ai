    "# Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we are going to build an implementation of the univariate decision tree algorithm that can classify using both discrete and numeric variables. It will be based off the pseudocode in figure 9.3 of *Alpaydin*, so study that first to understand the general idea of the algorithm. Besides figuring out how exactly to do these splits for discrete and numeric variables, this assignment will give us a chance to study the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Working with a more realistic data set. The Iris dataset is useful to get started, as it just works out of the box, but real world datasets will almost always be a lot messier. Having to do some preprocessing to end up with a usable representation is extremely common.\n",
    "* Working with more complex representations than just data in Nd-arrays. Many things can be captured as just collections of rows and columns, but if you want to build a structure like a tree (or a graph) then objects might be easier to work with. Creating objects in *Python* can be daunting at first if you are unfamiliar with them, but it will actually be easier to work with a complex represenation using these abstractions. They are a very useful tool to add to your arsenal.\n",
    "* Analysing the results of an algorithm. The results you get when you have (correctly) implemented the algorithm might surprise you. Trying to set up hypotheses about why this is the case and what you could do to improve / prevent / fix this, is a key skill in applying machine learning on real problems\n",

    "\n",
    "Lets start by looking at the [heart-disease.names](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/heart-disease.names) file, which contains a description of the data set. The file also gives an explanation for the values of the different variables, so when our tree is complete we can interpret the decision rules created by the algorithm. \n",

    "Some variables included here, like *#9 cp: chest pain type*, with 4 labels for different types of chest pain, are clearly discrete. And then are also variables like *#12 chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl*, containing the concentration of cholesterol, an obvious numeric value. The ability to handle both of these types of data is something not many other machine learning algorithms can do effectively, so in theory a decision tree should be perfect for this data.\n",

    "## Taking a first look [1 pt]\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by downloading the 4 `processed.X.data` files and loading them into *Numpy*. For this complete the by now familiar `load_data` function. Running this might give you an error, because not all values could be converted to a `float` or an `int`. Fix this by leaving the datatype as a `str` for now, so we can at least see what the data looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the 4 data sets, print the size of the data set and the first row of values. You should now see an unexpected value pop up, which probably indicates a missing value. The file describing the data sets states that missing values are indicated by $-9.0$, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Lets inspect the scope of this problem by writing the `count_missing` function, which should count the number of missing elements for each variable / column of a data set. The function should thus return an array of missing counts, one count for each variable in the data set. Print the results for each of the 4 data sets."

    "Looking at the results from the previous step, it seems like the sets from some hospitals are more complete than others. There are different approaches you might take to solve this, like replacing the missing values with the average value for that variable, or handling missing values within the algorithm in a seperate way. For now we will take the simplest approach, discarding any rows that contain missing values. This way we only use the complete patient records from each data set. Write the `remove_missing` function, which should remove any rows containing a missing value and return the new 2d-array. Combine all 4 cleaned sets into a single data array and print the shape to see how many patients we are left with.\n",

    "Now we should have about 300 patient records, most of which are from the Cleveland hospital. For each patient we have 14 variables, but we don't know which are discrete and which are numeric yet. We could study the description of each variable, see if can interpret them all and label them that way. However, a good automatic indicator might be the number of unique values for a variable, as you would expect that number to be much higher for numeric variables than for discrete ones. Write the function `unique_vals` which should return an array of the number of unique values for each column a data array. Use that function on the combined data array and print the resulting array of counts.\n",

Another thing that might stand out is the fact that the last column, the predicted variable according to the description file, has 5 separate values. Lets inspect how these values are distributed by writing the function `count_occurence`, which should take a single data column and return a dictionary with all possible values of a variable as the keys and their respective counts as the value. Print the resulting counts for the last column of the data array."

In the description file it says *Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing*, but it does not explain all the other values. It might be logical to assume these to be different degrees of narrowing, so $0$ would mean no disease and higher values would mean different levels of disease present. Because the distribution of the different values is so skewed, for now we will just focus on classifying the difference between a value of $0$ for the narrowing and any of the higher values. This means the **y** vector should just contain boolean value which is `True` if there is more than $50\\%$ narrowing and `False` otherwise.

The discrete variables are all whole numbers, so the resulting 2d-array should be of type `int` and the numeric variables array should of type `float`. You can return both together as a [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) (also works for the other split functions) and then use tuple unpacking to easily store them into separate variables.

This is related the idea of a universal entropy, as used in Asimov's classic short story [The Last Question](http://multivax.com/last_question.html).

    "Information Gain therefore measures how much the entropy changes from making a specific split, i.e. the relative gain in predicitablity of the data by making a specific distribution of labels. The IG thus depends on 2 things; the original list of labels and how these labels are divided into new distributions by the split. This last part will be specified by a list of lists of indices, where the first list contains all the indices of the labels that belong to the first part of the split, the second list contains the indices of the labels for the second part and so on. The reason for this format will become clearer as you write the actual code for the splitting function, for now just write the `information_gain` using your earlier functions `entropy` and `split_entropy` and assume `indices` is list containing a list of indices for each part of the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally write a `plot_entropy` function to check the entropy function works correctly. This function should create many different lists of boolean labels of length `N` and compute ratio and entropy for each of these lists. Note that for list of boolean of length $N$, there are only $N+1$ different possible ratios of labels you need to create. The x-axis of your plot should the ratios and the y-axis their resulting entropies, which should produce a graph like Figure 9.2 in *Alpaydin*. Show this plot at the end of your code and make sure it looks correct."

    "## DecisionTree class\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data turned into a usable format and combined, and the functions to measure entropy and IG ready, we can start building the actual decision tree. Classes are also a great way to represent trees, where each object is a node in the tree, which can itself contain several branches to other nodes. So the class only has the define the attributes and functions for one node, but repeating this structure can create complex trees. For our decision tree, we will have 2 types of nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DiscreteTree nodes, split on the value a discrete variable\n",
    "2. NumericTree nodes, split on the value of numeric variable\n",
    "\n",
    "For both of these the splits work slightly differently, but the nodes have many attributes in common too. In order to avoid repeating this in 2 classes, we will use *inheritance*, a very common object-oriented technique to solve this type of problem. Here we will define a parent class `DecisionTree` that will contain all the common elements for `DiscreteTree` and `NumericTree`. If you want to learn more about inheritance, you can read the section on *Inheritance* from [Jeff Knupp's introduction](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataRow` class created earlier was a straightforward class example, but here we will use some less intuitive Python to actually create a general `DecisionTree` node and then swap it out for a specific `DiscreteTree` or `NumericTree` instance based on the split results. This will actually simplify building a tree containing both numeric and discrete splits a lot. The `DecisionTree` class will thus not only hold all the common functions used for both the `DiscreteTree` and `NumericTree` nodes, but we will also use its `__init__` method as generic constructor for either specific type of node. The code to do this swap has already been provided, so you will only need to focus on writing the split methods for the `DiscreteTree` and `NumericTree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for now, nothing actually needs to be added in this class. There are 3 functions here that still need to be filled in: `create_subtrees`, `classify` and `validate`, but we will come back to those after the actual split function has been written, because logically, splitting the data needs to be implemented before these functions make any sense. Start by reading the code that has been provided here, so you have sense of the general structure, and most importantly, what the attributes are for each `DecisionTree` node."

    "## Discrete split [3 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start actually writing the `split` function for the `DiscreteTree`. This function should, for every discrete variable in the data, try to create a split based on that variable and compute the *Information Gain* of the resulting split. Note that if, for example, there are 3 different values a discrete variable can take, this means there will be 3 subsets as a result of the split, each corresponding to one of the values for the variable. Start by selecting out the \"column\" for the specific variable, i.e. a list containing all the values for that variable, retrieved from the `DataRow` instances. Use that to create a list of indices for each of the different subsets. Using the lists of indices and the current set of labels, computing the *IG* should be pretty easy with the functions you already wrote. The variable which results in the highest *IG* will become the actual split for this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best variable for the split has been determined, the results of the split need to be stored in the instance, so they can be used to build the rest of the tree. The following attributes should be stored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The index of the discrete variable based on which the split was done\n",
    "2. The list of unique values for which the split was done.\n",
    "3. The list of lists with the indices indicating the different subsets of the data that result from the split. The order of these lists should match to the order of the values in the previous point, each corresponding to one branch of the split.\n",
    "4. The Information Gain resulting from the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "These attributes can then be used to build the rest of the tree. Some version of these values are also needed for the `NumericTree` splits, so you can use the general function `store_split_values` from the `DecisionTree` class to store them in the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the subtrees [1 pt]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a function to split data for a single node, actually turning this into a complete tree should not be too complicated. The idea of the `DecisionTree` is to be able to take the result of the splits and split those further again. It is this pattern that creates a tree-structure, where you expect the classification accuracy to increase with every layer you add to the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many layers you add, i.e. how many splits you keep performing on the data, will obviously affect the results of classification. You could keep going until you seperate out every single row into a seperate leaf node of the tree, but this is very likely to overfit the data. There are quite a few strategies for how to prune the tree, i.e. limit the number of nodes to not overfit. The simplest of these is just to stop splitting when the *Information Gain* of a split drops below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what is already implemented as the last step in the `__init__` function of `DecisionTree`. Here the computed *Information Gain* is compared to the threshold and if the gain is too low, the node is labeled as a leaf node. If the node is not a leaf node, then further splits should be attemped and the `create_subtrees` function is called to populate the branches of this node with new subset `DecisionTrees`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets write that `create_subtrees` function. Start by using the indices attribute stored from the split result with the `store_split_values` function to create the actual data subsets. For each list with subset indices, slice out the `DataRows` from the data attribute belonging to that part of the split. Then repeat this for the labels, to slice out the labels corresponding to those same `DataRows`. This will be the data and label values with which you can now create a new `DecisionTree` for that slice result. You can repeat this to a create new `DecisionTree` for each split result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to actually find the correct `DecisionTree` node when we are classifying, each new `DecisionTree` should be stored in the `branches` dictionary of the node. Here the *key* should be the value of the discrete variable for that split (also stored using `store_split_values`) and the *value* should be the new `DecisionTree` resulting from that choice in the split. When this dictionary is complete, each key-value pair will represent a different branch of the tree at that split.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving the subtrees, classifying and validating [2 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, the tree building part of the algorithm is actually complete now. This would be a good time to try and visualize what all the code you just wrote actually does. Take out a pen and paper and try to draw the structure that would be built if you created a new `DecisionTree` using the training data, consisting of the `DataRows` and corresponding labels. No need to do the actual entropy math on paper, just try and sketch what objects would be created and how they would relate to each other. If you are have trouble visualizing this for such a large dataset, take a look at the small example tree in *Figure 9.6* in Alpaydin.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this whole structure built, actually classifying a new `DataRow` is pretty easy. First write the function `get_subtree` in `DiscreteTree`, which should return the correct `DecisionTree` one branch down, based on the split made in that node and the values in the `row` object. Remember that as part of the split you also stored the `DataRow` index of the variable used in the split with the `store_split_values` function. It is possible a discrete value is being classified that was not present in the training set at that point in the tree, in that case the function should return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now write the `classify` function in `DecisionTree` which should classify a `DataRow` using the built tree. There are only a couple of options when classifying on a node\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The node is a leaf node, in which case the classification will be the most common label of that node\n",
    "2. The node does not have a valid subtree for the splitted value, so the classification will also be the node label\n",
    "3. The node does have subtree for the splitted value, in which case you can recursively continue classifying on the subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, write a `validate` function in `DecisionTree` which should take a validation set of `DataRows` and corresponding labels, and return the percentage which was classified correctly. Create a `DecisionTree` using the training data, with `tree_type` set to $1$ (currently we can only do discrete splits) and print the results when validating with the validation set created earlier.\n"

    "Now we move on to adding the numeric splits to the tree. All the code already written in the `DecisionTree` class, can just be inherited down to the `NumericTree` class as well, meaning you will only need to write the 2 numeric-specific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important of these function is of course the `split` function. In the numeric case, it doesn't make sense to make a separate branch for every value, because there will be many different ones, so instead some values should be grouped together for generality. The numeric split is therefore based on a split boundary, where all values smaller than the boundary go in one branch, and those greater or equal go in the other branch. `NumericTrees` thus always have exactly 2 branches for each split, but there are many different ways a single variable might be split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the `split` function to, for each numeric variable, try every possible split boundary and the find the split with the best *IG* overall. Try and come up with a logical way to generate all possible ways to separate a set of numeric values into 2 sets using a split boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have determined the best possible split, use the `store_split_values` function from `DecisionTree` to store most of the attributes from this split. However, as this is a numeric split, the values attribute `var_values` should not contain all variable values, but instead be set to just a list with `[False, True]`. Here *False* will be the branch with the values smaller than the boundary, and *True* the branch for the values greater or equal than the boundary. Doing this ensures that this function will still work with the `create_subtrees` you already wrote. As a last addition, you should also store as an object attribute the split boundary for this best split, as you will need to compare new values to this same boundary in order to classify them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now write the `get_subtree` function, where you should compare the value of the variable on which the split was performed to the split boundary. Use this to get the correct subtree from the `branches` attribute, where *False* is for the smaller values and *True* for those greater or equal, as described in the section above.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these functions for the numeric split written, the `DecisionTree` class can be used to create the actual decision tree, just like for the `DiscreteTree`. Create 3 `DecisionTree` instances using the training data, with `tree_type` set to $0$, $1$ and $2$ respectively. Tree type 1 will contain only discrete splits, tree type 2 will contain only numeric splits and tree type 0 will try both and use the split with the highest information gain. Print the validation results for all 3 tree using the validation set created earlier."
